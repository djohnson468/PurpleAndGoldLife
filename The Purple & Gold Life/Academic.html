<h2>
Course Information Guide: Transfer Process & How to Manage Your Courses at Prairie View A&M University
</h2>

<p>
Navigating your courses at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) is one of the most important parts of your college experience. Understanding how the transfer process works, how courses are offered, and how to plan ahead can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress. This guide is designed to help freshmen and new students confidently manage their academic journey from day one.
</p>

<h2>Understanding the Transfer Process at PVAMU</h2>

<p>
Many students enter Prairie View A&M with prior college credit from dual enrollment, AP courses, community colleges, or other universities. While credits may transfer, how they apply to your degree can vary.
</p>

<p><b><u>How the transfer process works:</u></b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Request official transcripts from all previous institutions.</li>
    <li>Transcripts must be sent directly to PVAMU for evaluation.</li>
    <li>The Office of Admissions reviews and processes transfer credits.</li>
    <li>Approved credits appear in DegreeWorks, which shows how courses apply to your degree.</li>
    <li>Some credits may transfer as electives instead of major requirements.</li>
</ol>

<p><b><u>Important things to keep in mind:</u></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Not all transferred courses automatically fulfill major requirements.</li>
    <li>Course equivalencies depend on department approval.</li>
    <li>Credit evaluation can take time, especially during peak registration periods.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Best practices for transfer students:</u></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Submit transcripts early, preferably before advising and registration.</li>
    <li>Save syllabi for transferred courses in case additional review is needed.</li>
    <li>Meet with your academic advisor to confirm how credits fit into your degree plan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Courses Are Offered at Prairie View A&M</h2>

<p>
One of the biggest mistakes students make is assuming all courses are offered every semester. At PVAMU, course availability depends on department scheduling and demand.
</p>

<p><b><u>What you need to know:</u></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Some courses are <b><u>Fall-only</u></b> or <b><u>Spring-only</u></b>.</li>
    <li>Upper-level courses may be offered once per academic year.</li>
    <li>Certain classes require prerequisites that must be completed first.</li>
    <li>Course availability may change based on faculty or enrollment numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>How to stay ahead:</u></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Review the course catalog for your major.</li>
    <li>Check previous semesters to see when classes were offered.</li>
    <li>Ask advisors or department offices about future course availability.</li>
    <li>Avoid pushing required courses to later semesters without confirmation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Planning around course availability is key to graduating on time.</p>

    <li>Prevents missing required or sequence-based courses.</li>
    <li>Helps balance course difficulty each semester.</li>
