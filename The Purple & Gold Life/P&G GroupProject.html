<h2><center>Organization Fair and Recruitment Events</center></h2>
<p>One of the best ways for students to learn about campus organizations is through the organization fair during Welcome Week. During this event, student organizations set up booths across campus, showcasing what they do and encouraging students to apply or attend meetings. Students can walk around, speak with current members, ask questions, and sign up to join organizations that interest them. This event is a great opportunity to meet leaders of different groups and learn about the responsibilities and benefits of being involved.
<br>

</br>
Even after Welcome Week, many organizations host recruitment events throughout the semester to welcome new members. Attending these fairs and events helps students explore options, make informed choices, and start their involvement on a strong note. It’s also a fun way to see the energy and creativity of campus life while connecting with others</p>
