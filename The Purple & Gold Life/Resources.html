</p>

<p> For more information regarding meal plans visit: 
<a href = "https://www.pvamu.edu/auxiliaryservices/food-services/meal-plan-options/" class="goldlink"> https://www.pvamu.edu/auxiliaryservices/food-services/meal-plan-options/ 
</a> 
</p>

<h4> Determining Which Meal Plan is Best For You! </h4>

<p> 

The meal plans are separated by dining hall meals and Pantherbucks (meal points).

<br>
<br> 

Your dining hall meals are essentially the paid-for meals you get from dining in the cafeteria, the zone, and some food items in the Strike Zone. These meal swipes are limited per week and reset every Monday morning. If you go over your allotted amount of meal swipes for the week, you will have to use another form of payment. 

<br>
<br>

Your Pantherbucks (meal points) are essentially money that you can spend outside of dining halls. These can be spent at all of the participating locations.  

<ul>

<li>The Strike Zone (on campus)</li>

<li>Chick-fil-a (on campus)</li>

<li>The Bistro (on campus)</li>

<li>Panther Mart (on campus)</li>

<li>Dunkin' Donuts (on campus)</li>

<li>PV Mart (on campus)</li>

<li>Yang's Kitchen (off campus)</li>

<li>Waller County Line (off campus)</li>

</ul>

<p> ...and more! </p>

<p>For the fall and spring semesters, the meal plans are dispensed like so:</p> 

<table class="meal-table">
  <tr>
    <th>Meal Plan</th>
    <th>Points</th>
    <th>Fee</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>17 Meals</td>
    <td>300</td>
    <td>
      <span class="fee">$1786.45</span>
      <span class="note">(Mandatory for Freshmen)</span>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>14 Meals</td>
    <td>375</td>
    <td><span class="fee">$1786.45</span></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>10 Meals</td>
    <td>400</td>
    <td><span class="fee">$1786.45</span></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>7 Meals</td>
    <td>425</td>
    <td>
      <span class="fee">$1786.45</span>
      <span class="note">(Available for Seniors only)</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Another thing to note: the more meal swipes you have, the less pantherbucks you have and vice versa. 
If you'd frequent the dining hall the most, select the meal plan with more meals.
If you do not visit the dining hall often, select the meal plan with less meals and more points.

<h3> Study Areas </h3>

<img src= "images/studyarea.png" height="250">

<p> There are various areas across campus for students to find their ideal study space.</p>


<p>At the library, there are areas on the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors that you can utilize. For a more secluded study session, the 1<sup>st</sup> floor has a designated quiet area, there are study nooks available on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors. There are also study rooms that you can reserve. The library has many resources from computers to whiteboards, to make for the perfect study session.</p>

<p>In many of the on-campus housing there are study rooms available. These rooms can be accessed near your own dorm. Many of these rooms are available 24/7 and have whiteboards, TVs, and seclusion.</p> 

<p>Many of your class schedule locations make for great study areas! Many of the buildings across campus have areas with chairs and tables that make for a great study session before and after class. Some common buildings students go to study are the Agriculture Business Building, the C. L. Wilson Engineering Building, and the new Engineering Building.</p>
